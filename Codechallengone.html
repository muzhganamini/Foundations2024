        <h2>HTML Codes</h2>
        <p class="htmlCode">HTML, which stands for HyperText Markup Language, is the backbone of the internet. It serves as the standard markup language for creating web pages and applications. HTML uses a system of tags and attributes to structure content on a webpage, defining elements such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, and more. It provides a way to organize and present information on the web, making it accessible to users across different devices and platforms. With HTML, developers can create rich and interactive web experiences, incorporating multimedia elements, forms for user input, and semantic markup for better search engine optimization. As a foundational technology of the World Wide Web, HTML continues to evolve, with new features and standards introduced to support the ever-changing landscape of digital content creation and consumption.</p>

        <h2>CSS codes</h2>
        <p class="cssCode"> CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a crucial component of web development that enhances the presentation and visual appeal of HTML documents. Acting as a styling language, CSS allows developers to define the appearance of web pages by specifying the layout, colors, fonts, and other design aspects. By separating the content (HTML) from its presentation (CSS), developers can achieve greater flexibility and maintainability in their projects. CSS operates through a system of rules, selectors, and properties, where selectors target specific HTML elements and properties define their visual characteristics. This separation of concerns enables developers to easily update and modify the styling across multiple pages or an entire website by simply editing the CSS file. With CSS, designers can create responsive and accessible layouts, implement animations and transitions, and ensure consistency and coherence in the user interface. As web technologies continue to evolve, CSS remains an essential tool for crafting engaging and user-friendly digital experiences on the internet.</p>
